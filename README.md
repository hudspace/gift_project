GiftBuddy is a simple solution for tracking gift ideas for the special people in your life. It allows the user to make a list of potential gift recipients, then in a separate form, enter gift ideas whenever they occur. The gift ideas can optionally include an intended recipient, a model number, and a price. The final output is the user-entered list of recipients combined with their associated gift ideas, along with a total budget for all items (basically, a shopping list). As gift items are checked off (either marked as gifted or deleted), the remaining displayed budget is adjusted automatically.
