# gift_project
GiftBuddy is intended as a simple solution for tracking gift ideas as they occur. It allows the user to enter potential gift recipients at any time in a simple form, then in a separate form, enter gift ideas whenever they occur. The gift ideas can optionally include an intended recipient, a model number, and a price. The final output is the user-entered list of recipients combined with their potential gifts, and a total budget required for all items (basically, a shopping list). As gift items are checked off (either marked as gifted or deleted), the remaining displayed budget is adjusted automatically.
